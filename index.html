         <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Kansas City, Kansas is the first place I have been on vacation, and also the
            place
            I have been too the most.
            This state is very close to my heart because it is where most of my family on my dad's side is from.
            I first met my Grandfather and some of my cousins on my first trip there when I was very young.

         <h2 id="detroit">Detroit, MI</h2>
         <p>Detroit is the second place I have been to on vacation, also when I was very young. this is where most of my
            family on my mom's side used to live. I went to visit my Great Grandmother,
            once when I was born, a second time when I was around three years old and a final time for her funeral a few
            years
            ago.

         <h2 id="branson">Branson, MO</h2>
         <p>Branson, Missouri, is one of the best places I have been too. I have only gone once, again, when I was
            pretty
            young. We visited the beach a few times and saw a Stage preformance there.
            I don't remember many things about that time but what I do remember was lots of fun.
